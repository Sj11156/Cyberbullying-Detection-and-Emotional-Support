# Cyberbullying-Detection-and-Emotional-Support

This project is an AI-powered system designed to detect cyberbullying and emotional distress on social media platforms. It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) to analyze user-generated content in real-time, classify harmful or abusive language, detect depression levels, and provide mental health support via an integrated chatbot. The system also features admin and caretaker modules for timely intervention.
